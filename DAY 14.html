        <h2>INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>The universe (Latin: universus) is all of space and time[a] and their contents,[10] including planets,
            stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. The Big Bang theory is the prevailing 
            cosmological description of the development of the universe. According to this theory, space and 
            time emerged together 13.787±0.020 billion years ago,[11] and the universe has been expanding 
            since the Big Bang. While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,[3] it is possible
            to measure the size of the 
            observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day.</p>
