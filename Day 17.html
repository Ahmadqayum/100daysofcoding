        <p>The rest of this document shows some of what you can do with simple HTML commands, but I don't 
            explain how to do it. To see that, just tell your browser to <b>View Source</b> and compare 
            the HTML in the source window with the result in the original window.<br>
            <i>Note</i>: In this and the following sections, I use some "deprecated" features from earlier HTML
            versions because they are easier for beginners to learn (for example versus)
            <b>This sentence is bold.</b> <i>This sentence is italics.</i> <i><b>This sentence is in bold italics.</b></i>
            <a style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace">This sentence is in typewriter font.</a> 
            This sentence has <a style="text-decoration:underline;">underlined words</a> and <b><a style="text-decoration:underline ;">underlined bold words.</a></b>
           <a style="color:blue">This</a> <a style="color:red">sentence</a> <a style="color:green">has</a> <a style="color:brown">colored</a> <a style="color:pink">words.</a> <br>
            This sentence has <a style="font-size:medium">big words.</a>  This one has very <a style="font-size:larger ;">big words.</a> This one has <a style="font-size:smaller ;">very small words.</a> 
            This is a "blackquote", which is like a regular paragraph, but it has bigger margins.
            Environments such as blackquotes, lists, etc, they have a beginning and an end always
            use paired commands like.
            This is a blackquote inside another blockquote, which shows how HTML environments can be
            "nested".<br><br>
            Here we are back in the first blockquote again.
